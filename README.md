# 🎛️ Rotation

**A vinyl discovery platform that makes crate digging feel like scrolling through your favorite app.**

Rotation transforms the way DJs, record collectors, and music lovers discover vinyl. Instead of browsing static catalog listings, users scroll through an interactive feed of records with embedded audio previews, curated by record stores and selectors worldwide.

## What is Rotation?

Rotation is like **Instagram for vinyl records** — a visual, audio-rich discovery platform that brings the excitement of crate digging to your screen. Record stores can showcase their inventory as curated feeds, while music lovers can discover new releases and rare finds with instant audio previews.

### For Record Collectors & DJs
- 🎵 **Instant Audio Previews** — Listen before you buy with embedded tracks
- 📱 **Swipe-Style Discovery** — Scroll through records like your favorite social feed  
- 🏪 **Store-Curated Feeds** — Browse inventory from record stores worldwide
- 🎯 **Smart Matching** — Advanced audio matching connects vinyl to digital previews

### For Record Stores
- 📈 **Showcase Your Inventory** — Turn your catalog into an engaging, browsable feed
- 🎛️ **Easy Management** — Upload inventory from Discogs with one click
- 🎵 **Automated Audio Matching** — System finds audio previews for your records automatically
- 🌍 **Global Reach** — Connect with vinyl lovers beyond your local area

## ✨ How It Works

1. **Record stores connect their Discogs inventory** to create curated feeds
2. **Smart audio matching** automatically finds previews for vinyl records
3. **Users browse and discover** records through an intuitive scroll interface  
4. **Direct purchase links** connect discovery to sales

## 🎵 Audio Previews

Rotation's intelligent audio matching system connects vinyl records to digital previews from multiple sources:

- **Discogs embedded videos** (prioritized for accuracy)
- **YouTube audio matching** with confidence scoring
- **Planned**: Apple Music integration for comprehensive coverage

*Note: Not every record has available audio previews. When previews aren't available, users can still discover and purchase records with clear messaging like "Listening only available in-store."*

## 🔜 What's Coming

- Enhanced discovery algorithms and personalization
- Social features — follow stores, share finds, create wishlists
- Mobile app for on-the-go discovery
- Advanced curation tools for stores and selectors
