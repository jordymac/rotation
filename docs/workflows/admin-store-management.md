# Admin Store Management Workflow

This document outlines how the admin interface should work for store management, distinguishing between technical system metrics and business-focused store owner metrics.

## Overview

The admin system has two distinct interfaces:
1. **Multi-Store Admin Dashboard** - Platform administrators managing multiple stores
2. **Individual Store Management** - Store owners managing their specific inventory

## Multi-Store Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)

### Purpose
Platform administrators need to monitor and manage multiple stores across the platform.

### What Store Owners See
**Business-Focused Metrics:**
- **Total Inventory** - Complete count of releases for sale on Discogs (what matters to store owners)
- **Views/Wishlists/Sales** - Customer engagement metrics (future implementation)
- **Last Sync** - When their inventory was last updated
- **Store Status** - Active, processing, error states

**Processing Status (Secondary):**
- Audio match progress for processed releases
- Background processing queue status

### What Store Owners Should NOT See
**Technical/Developer Metrics:**
- Internal cache statistics
- Database table counts
- Raw processing queue details
- System implementation details

### Implementation Notes
- Uses `/api/admin/stores/[id]/stats` endpoint
- Makes minimal Discogs API call (1 request for count only)
- Shows real business metrics, not internal caching details
- Fast response time suitable for dashboard overview

## Individual Store Management (`/stores/[storeId]`)

### Purpose
Store owners need to verify and manage audio matches for their complete inventory.

### What Store Owners See
**Complete Inventory Management:**
- **ALL releases** from their Discogs store (not just cached ones)
- Audio verification interface for each release
- Track-by-track audio matching modal
- Approve/reject functionality for YouTube matches
- Complete release details and metadata

### Key Requirements
- Must show **complete Discogs inventory** regardless of processing status
- Should not be limited to cached/processed releases only
- Includes both processed releases (with audio matches) and unprocessed releases
- Uses `?revalidate=1` parameter to force fresh inventory fetch

### Implementation Notes
- Uses `/api/stores/[storeId]/inventory?revalidate=1` endpoint
- Forces fresh Discogs API call to get complete inventory
- Returns merged data: cached releases + new releases from Discogs
- Suitable for comprehensive audio verification workflow

## API Endpoints

### Admin Stats: `/api/admin/stores/[id]/stats`
**Purpose:** Lightweight dashboard metrics
**Performance:** Fast (minimal API calls)
**Returns:** Business-focused store metrics

```json
{
  "stats": {
    "collectionCount": 47,           // Total Discogs inventory
    "inventoryStatus": "active",      // Store health status
    "audioMatchPercentage": 25,       // % of processed releases with matches
    "processedReleases": 12,          // Releases that have been processed
    "views": 0,                       // Customer engagement (future)
    "wishlists": 0,                   // Customer engagement (future)
    "sales": 0,                       // Business metrics (future)
    "queue": {                        // Background processing status
      "pending": 35,
      "completed": 12
    }
  }
}
```

### Store Inventory: `/api/stores/[id]/inventory?revalidate=1`
**Purpose:** Complete inventory for management
**Performance:** Slower (full Discogs API call)
**Returns:** Complete store inventory for audio verification

```json
{
  "results": [...],                   // All releases (cached + fresh)
  "pagination": { "items": 47 },      // Total inventory count
  "cacheStats": {                     // Technical details
    "cached": 12,
    "fresh": 35,
    "total": 47
  }
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Store Owner Journey
1. **Admin Dashboard** - See business overview (total inventory, customer metrics)
2. **Manage Store** - Access complete inventory for audio verification
3. **Audio Verification** - Review and approve/reject audio matches per release
4. **Processing Status** - Monitor background processing of new releases

### Key Principles
- **Business-first metrics** on dashboard (not technical details)
- **Complete inventory access** for management (not limited to cache)
- **Clear distinction** between overview stats and detailed management
- **Performance optimized** for each use case

## Error Handling

### Dashboard Stats Issues
- If Discogs API fails, show last known inventory count
- Clear error states for store connectivity issues
- Graceful degradation for partial data

### Inventory Management Issues
- Fallback to cached data if Discogs API unavailable
- Clear messaging about data freshness
- Retry mechanisms for failed background processing

## Future Enhancements

### Business Metrics
- Real customer view tracking
- Wishlist engagement analytics
- Sales performance metrics
- Store discovery and recommendation data

### Advanced Management
- Bulk audio match operations
- Inventory synchronization controls
- Performance analytics and insights
- Customer engagement tools
