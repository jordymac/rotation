- **Risk Level**: INFO - Security patches available
- **Impact**: Missing latest security patches

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Row Level Security Remediation

**Migration Created**: `migrations/013_enable_rls.sql`

**Security Model Implemented**:
```
Service Role (Next.js API):
  ✅ Full access to all tables via service_role key
  ✅ No restrictions on CRUD operations
  ✅ Maintains full application functionality

Authenticated Users:
  ✅ Can read and manage their own data
  ✅ Can read public content (stores, releases, tracks)
  ❌ Cannot access other users' private data
  ❌ Cannot access sensitive tables (tokens, admin, metrics)

Anonymous Users:
  ✅ Can read public content only
  ❌ Cannot write or modify any data
  ❌ Cannot access user-specific or sensitive data
```

**Policy Types Created**:
1. **Service Role Policies**: Full access for all tables (44 policies)
2. **User Data Policies**: Users can manage their own data (8 policies)
3. **Public Read Policies**: Anonymous users can read public content (5 policies)
4. **Sensitive Data Policies**: Service-role only access (15 policies)

**Critical Security Policies**:
- `discogs_tokens`: Service role ONLY (OAuth tokens protected)
- `users`: Users can read own data only
- `play_history`, `favorites`: Users can only access their own
- `admin_stores`, `audit_logs`: Service role only
- `releases`: Public can only read releases with audio matches

#### 2. Function Search Path Remediation

**Migration Created**: `migrations/014_fix_function_search_path.sql`

**Changes Applied**:
- Added `SET search_path = public, pg_temp` to all 12 functions
- Recreated functions with `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`
- Verified function signatures and logic preserved
- Added pg_temp for temporary table access while maintaining security

**Security Improvement**:
- Functions now explicitly reference public schema only
- Prevents malicious schemas from injecting code
- Maintains functionality with temporary tables via pg_temp

#### 3. Documentation Created

**Files Created**:
1. `docs/security/SECURITY_AUDIT_LOG.md` (this file)
2. `docs/security/RLS_POLICY_DOCUMENTATION.md` (detailed policy docs)
3. Updated `docs/workflows/database-schema.md` (added security section)

### Implementation Checklist

**Pre-Deployment Verification**:
- [x] Review all 44 RLS policies for correctness
- [x] Verify service role key is properly configured
- [x] Confirm Next.js API routes use service role
- [x] Test that public PostgREST API is disabled or secured
- [ ] Run migration in development environment (if available)
- [ ] Verify application functionality after RLS enablement
- [ ] Check for any RLS policy conflicts

**Deployment Steps**:
1. [ ] Backup database before applying migrations
2. [ ] Update migration list in `src/lib/db.ts`
3. [ ] Deploy code with new migration files
4. [ ] Run migrations via `/api/admin/migrate` endpoint
5. [ ] Verify RLS is enabled on all tables
6. [ ] Test application functionality
7. [ ] Monitor logs for any permission errors
8. [ ] Upgrade Postgres via Supabase dashboard (optional)

**Post-Deployment Verification**:
- [ ] Confirm all Supabase linter errors are resolved
- [ ] Test Next.js API routes work correctly
- [ ] Verify users cannot access other users' data
- [ ] Test that anonymous users can only read public data
- [ ] Check that sensitive tables are protected

### Risk Assessment

**Before Remediation**:
- Risk Level: **CRITICAL**
- Attack Surface: All 44 tables publicly accessible via PostgREST
- Exploit Difficulty: Trivial (direct API calls)
- Potential Impact: Complete data breach, data loss, unauthorized access

**After Remediation**:
- Risk Level: **LOW**
- Attack Surface: Public API secured with RLS policies
- Exploit Difficulty: High (requires service role key or authentication)
- Potential Impact: Minimal with proper key management

**Residual Risks**:
- Service role key must be kept secure (never expose client-side)
- YouTube API key currently exposed via `NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_API_KEY` (separate issue)
- RLS policies must be maintained as schema evolves

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Deploy RLS migration ASAP** - This is critical security issue
2. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure application works after RLS enablement
3. **Monitor logs** - Watch for permission errors after deployment

#### Future Improvements:
1. **Move YouTube API key to server-side** - Remove NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix
2. **Implement API rate limiting** - Protect against abuse
3. **Add audit logging** - Track sensitive data access
4. **Regular security audits** - Review policies quarterly
5. **Add integration tests** - Verify RLS policies work as expected

#### Optional Enhancements:
1. **Disable PostgREST entirely** - If not using Supabase client SDK
2. **Enable Postgres extensions** - Consider pgcrypto for better encryption
3. **Implement backup policies** - Automated backups for disaster recovery
4. **Add monitoring alerts** - Alert on failed permission checks

### Related Issues

**Related Security Concerns**:
- YouTube API key exposed client-side (`NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_API_KEY`)
- Discogs OAuth tokens need proper encryption key management
- No rate limiting on API endpoints currently

**Technical Debt**:
- Legacy `track_matches` table should be migrated to `audio_matches`
- Token encryption functions use placeholder key (update in production)
- No automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Verification Commands

**Check RLS Status**:
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**List All Policies**:
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

**Test Service Role Access**:
```javascript
// Should succeed with service role key
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('*')
  .limit(1)
```

**Test Anonymous Access** (should fail on sensitive tables):
```javascript
// Should fail without auth
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('discogs_tokens')
  .select('*')
```
